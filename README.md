TV Series / Movie Tracker

This is a more advanced version of my previous series tracker project. 

A simple web application to track the TV Series & Movies that we watch. 

What inspired me to do this project: 
  We love watching TV Series, we have an eclectic list of TV Series that is stored in a note app on partner's iPad. Because we don't like binge watching a series, we watch each one of them everytime we have lunch & dinner, so having a list acts as an indicator on what we should watch next. After we've watched an episode of that series, we would both rate the episode and average it and put the rating on IMDB.
  Moving an item on that note app is a pain in the a**, sometimes it works but most of the times it doesn't. It also doesn't indicate on when an item was updated or moved. My partner also does IF (intermittent fasting), so taking track of time of lunch and dinner is really important. 
  So that inspired me to create this app. This app does everything we do on a daily basis. 
  
What I've learned so far throughout making this project:
  * Javascript's async and await function.
  * How to connect to an API and produce results. Thanks to omdbapi.com for the API.
  * Saving items on local storage.
  
What's working:
  * Searching for series and fetching results from OMDB API.
  * Adding series on your list.
  * Adding a series on your archive (waiting for new season, waiting for update of the series)
  * Deleting a series on your watch list.
  
  
 What's not working:
  * Movie tracker
  * Archive page
